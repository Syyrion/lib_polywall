[] - index for layers
() - call for keys



Layer indexing - indexing while filtering with layers:
Basewall[nil] -> self.layer -> functions that work on all layers
Basewall[l] -> self.layer[l] -> functions that work on single layers
Basewall[l](nil) -> self.layer[l].set -> functions that work on all walls within a layer
Basewall[l](key) -> self.layer[l].set[key] - functions that work on a single wall


Key indexing - bypass layer filtering by directly indexing walls
Basewall(nil) -> self.layerMap -> functions that work on all walls on all layers(?)
Basewall(key) -> self.layer[self.layerMap[key]].set[key] -> functions that work on a single wall
