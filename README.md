# lib_polywall
PolyWall library for Open Hexagon

This library is used to create custom walls in the game [Open Hexagon](https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVOpenHexagon). These custom walls generally behave like normal walls but can be manipulated in more ways than just a normal wall, such as by using lambda transformation functions. This library also enables custom walls to be assigned to layers to keep things organized. Layers can also be used for Z-Layering, which allows walls on certain layers to always display above or below other layers. (This feature is currently unsupported by the base game but is planned to be added.)
